Easily sell your digital goods with iThemes Exchange, simple ecommerce for WordPress

== Description ==

= SELL YOUR STUFF ONLINE IN UNDER 5 MINUTES =
We've made it easy to get your store up and running by making the process simple. Just install, activate, choose your payment methods and start adding your products.

= A SIMPLE INTERFACE =
Your products are not blog posts. So we created an experience that makes creating products simpler and more intuitive.

= SIMPLE BUT EXTENDABLE =
An online store can get pretty complicated. And not everyone needs the same things.

With iThemes Exchange, many features are split into add-ons. You only see what your store needs, making it simple to use and manage.

= GET PAID WITH PAYPAL OR STRIPE =
We designed Exchange's purchase experience with Stripe as the ideal payment gateway. Stripe is awesome. If you've used it, you know.

Not ready for Stripe yet? Exchange supports PayPal Standard out-of-the-box.

= CUSTOMERS MANAGEMENT MADE EASY =
We don't create our own database tables for users. We use the same built-in WordPress user system and add customer data to its own page, making it simple to edit their transactions, view available downloads and make customer notes for your reference.

= MADE BY ITHEMES =
We've been building and supporting WordPress tools for 5 years. With our full range of WordPress themes, plugins and training, ecommerce is the next step in providing you with everything you need to build the WordPress web.

We hope you'll try Exchange and love it. But we also want to hear what we can do to make it work best for your business.
